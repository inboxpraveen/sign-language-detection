# sign-language-detection
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting sign language. Utilizing a Sequential model built with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers in Keras, the project translates sign language into text or speech, enhancing communication accessibility for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
